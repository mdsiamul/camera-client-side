                        <p class="about-paddingB">The sheer immediacy of digital photography is impossible to beat with film. In most cases, you simply point your camera, click, and you have your image. No waiting until all the films used up, no time-consuming processing. Having your image in a digital format gives you many more options for what you can do with it, compared to film.</p>
